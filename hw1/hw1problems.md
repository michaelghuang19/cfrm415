For each of the computational problems, you may assume the payments are evenly spaced over each year.

1. Find the accumulated value of $100 at the end of 20 years:

      a) If the annual interest rate is 6% simple interest

      b) If the annual interest rate is 6% compounded quarterly

      c) If the annual interest rate is 6% compounded continuously

2. Find the present value of $100 to be paid in 20 years

      a) If the annual interest rate is 2% simple interest

      b) If the annual interest rate is 2% compounded semiannually

      c) If the annual interest rate is 2% compounded continuously

3. Find the annual rate of interest at which the accumulated value of $1000 at the end of 15 years is $3000

      a) If interest is compounded semiannually

      b) If interest is compounded continuously

4. A dealer of questionable repute prices a used car at $10,000, and it offers a four-year loan at 18% compounded monthly, where the customer must pay $250 per month.  How much will the down payment be?  

5. A junk bond pays a semiannual coupon at an 8% annual with 5 years to maturity, with a face value of $5000.  The market yield is 2%.

      a) Calculate the bond price

      b) Calculate the Macaulay Duration of the bond

      c) The market yield jumps to 2.02%.  What is the approximate change in the bond price?

6. A 10-year bond paying a semiannual coupon of 3.5% has been issued and is trading in the market.  It has a face value of $5000 and matures in two years and two months.  The market yield is 1.3%.  Calculate the bond price.

7. Show that the modified duration of a continuously compounded zero coupon bond is equal to its time to maturity.
